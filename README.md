# NEATJulia

[![Build Status](https://github.com/Rithvik-Reddy-Adapa/NEATJulia.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/Rithvik-Reddy-Adapa/NEATJulia.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml?query=branch%3Amain)

*!! A hobby project built from scratch, can have bugs ü™≤. !!*

Inspired from the concept of [NEAT (Neuro-Evolution of Augmenting Topologies)](https://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf), i.e., evolving nature of Neural Network (NN) using Genetic Algorithm (GA).

## Features
- __Multi-Threaded__ for better performance.
- Supports both __FFNNs__ (Feed-Forward Neural Networks) & __RNNs__ (Recurrent Neural Networks).
- Supports both __Forward Connections__ & __Backward Connections__.
- Support for __LSTM__ (Long-Short Term Memory) & __GRU__ (Gated Recurrent Unit) nodes under RNNs.
- __Log to file__ & __Log to console__.
- Ability to __save__ & __load__ entire NEAT struct or just a/specific Network(s). Ability to save NEAT struct every *n* iterations of training.
- Can export dot language code to __Visualize Network__. Can also export to *.svg*, but requires `dot` executable available in the path.
- You can have different mutation probabilities for different types of nodes and connections.
